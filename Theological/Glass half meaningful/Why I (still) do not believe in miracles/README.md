As a good Christian boy, I believed in the Bible, and in the miraculous stories recorded therein. But I didn’t believe that God still worked miracles today. I had never come to some official belief in “Cessationism”–it was a de facto belief, not something very explicitly thought through or overtly stated. I believed in the Christian God, and I believed in His omnipotence and beneficence, it just seemed like He didn’t “work that way” anymore, and I was cool with that. This seemed to be the operational belief (if not the theoretical belief) of my local church and denomination too, which may seem odd, given their emphasis on inerrancy/infallibility, and considering verses from the inerrant/infallible Word of God like the following:

*James 5:14-18 14Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 15And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 16Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 17Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. 18And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.*

That “shall” seems to guarantee that the faithful prayer of the faithful Christian WILL result in healing, not might, not “if it’s God’s will”, but WILL result in healing. Now consider this passage:

*John 14:12-14 12Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 13And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.*

Those shalls and wills sure seem pretty “empowering”, to use a modern catchphrase. Last time I checked, the New Testament reports that Jesus:
  * Walked on water
  * Healed lepers, the blind, the palsied, etc
  * Turned 5 (7) loaves and 2 (2 < n ≤ 4) fishes into more than enough food for 5,000 (4,000) men (plus their women and children, if/when present)
  * Correctly predicted major geopolitical events
  * Raised men from the dead
  * Predicted he’d be raised from the dead (and followed through)
  * Walked through walls
  * Publicly ascended to Heaven, splendiferously

Now, the passage from John above does not state that “occasionally, Christians will be granted special gifts if/when God deems them necessary to expand his kingdom”. No, Jesus states (to paraphrase), “Believers, in general, will do what I did… AND MORE!!!” I’ve known many believers, and I have witnessed zero miracles, although there are reports of faith healings which seem to be not bullshit. Walking on water, effortlessly feeding thousands of hungry people when given only a few servings of food, correctly predicting significant geopolitical events, and raising people from the dead – this I have not encountered, even indirectly. But faith healings, though most I have heard about or “seen” on TV seem to be bullshit, more than a few seem to not be, and this brings us to the primary topic of this blog: if the God of the universe is not the God of the Bible, as I came to conclude years ago, why do more than a few Christians seem to succeed in calling upon Him to heal themselves or those they care about?

This brings us to a Christian friend for whom I have the utmost respect: Robert Lee White*. I know there are Christians who have read more scholarly material relevant to Christianity (on the Christian side and the non-Christian side), but I don’t know them personally. I’m sure there are other such intellectual, well-read Christians who are as open to sincerely considering non-facile counterarguments to The Faith as Robert Lee is, but again, I don’t know them personally. So, before I get started, I have to say: hats off to Robert Lee.**

He cares about saving my soul–returning me to Christianity–in all selflessness. He also probably cares about defeating me in the context of our ongoing “conflict of visions” as much as I or any other nerdilicious philosóphes would care about such intellectual victories. And the latest way he has tried to argumentationally back me into a corner is using fairly-well-documented cases of Christian invalids receiving supposedly miraculous healings.

When he speaks of his extensive readings on purported miraculous healings, he makes an analogy to recalcitrant inerrantists. You can show them example after example of what seem to be contradictions within the Bible, and they always “cleverly” (sophistically, though not without occasional ingeniousness) weasel their way out of admitting what seems to be an obvious conclusion: the Bible is not 100% internally consistent. He claims that after exposure to case after case of purported faith healings, it will be the unbeliever rather than the believer who will show himself to be a recalcitrantly doctrinaire dogmatist.***

At first, I thought he was just employing wishful thinking and confirmation bias, but when he exposed me to story after story, though it didn’t reconvert me in one fell swoop, it did make me want to admit to myself, “Maybe I am committing the ‘sin of dogmatic rationalism’\**** that I have heard about from Robert Lee and many other Christians, scholars and laymen alike.”

A blog is no place for detailed description of all of the arguments found in a scholarly article; one case will suffice:

*A qualitative study reported by Dr. Bruno Klopfer is most illuminating. A patient of his who suffered from severe cancer demanded that he be given a new drug, which had been promoted as a so-called miracle cure in a scientific journal. After a single dose, Klopfer reports that the man’s cancer “melted like snowballs on a hot stove” (Hurley 1991, 30). The man was healed of his cancer and returned to life as normal. Unfortunately, the patient became aware of studies that attacked the efficacy of the miracle drug, and suddenly, his cancer began spreading again. He returned to Dr. Klopfer, who (acting from a hunch) told him not to believe those studies and gave him another dose of the drug, claiming that they were an “improved” dose. The patient’s cancer once again receded, and he began to recover, until he read another scientific journal in which the miracle drug had been conclusively proven as ineffective on cancer. Several days later, the patient passed away (Hurley 1991, 29–30).*

*[…]*

*Consider the case mentioned earlier of the cancer patient who believed in the miracle cure. Because of cultural and social factors, the patient must have believed that if scientists, who are generally idealized in modern Western society, said that a particular drug was the perfect cure for his cancer, then it must be true. The patient may have been conditioned to expect the medicine to elicit a certain result—to cure him of his cancer. Conditioning, then, may have been crucial to the formation of his worldview: he must have learned that scientists strive to find real cures that actually work. Thus, although the drug was proved in the end to be inert, his belief that it would help him initially cured him. Unfortunately, when that belief was violated, and his worldview and so-called faith were challenged, the cancer returned and took his life.*

Wow! If this case had been one in the Christian context, and the patient had just received prayer from his church before the doctor reported that the cancer “melted like snowballs on a hot stove”, this would be enough to qualify as a miracle of God to most Christians hearing this testimony, and enough for open-minded skeptics to perhaps be a little skeptical of their skepticism. But it is in a completely secular context, and it is an illustration that the placebo effect can be much more powerful than an unacquainted person like myself (before I read the article) would ever dream. The biological pathways for this placebo effect are fairly well-understood, and I’ll refer you to the article to learn about them.

This effect of the mind on the body’s immune system I now understand to have personally experienced, after reading this article. The author describes how anxiety and stress release a chemical that prioritizes fight or flight bodily functions, to address immediate danger(s), to the severe detriment of the immune system, a system which is very important on average, but which the body scales back in order to focus more energy on the current “attack” (whether real or imagined). I have had severe and chronic insomnia since I was 14, and I also have had a notably weak immune system since that time: I get more frequent and more severe colds than most people. It’s such a notable difference compared to the average person, that my friends tease me thus: “Do you have AIDS, Manny?” (Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome) As another proof of my relative sickliness, I have been fired from a job for calling in sick for the umpteenth time (I really was sick again!). Of course, the only way to not sleep while in bed and in dire need of sleep is to have constant anxiety (the fear of not sleeping and all the concomitant consequences prevents me from sleeping… gotta love self-fulfilling prophecies 😒). This nightly anxiety (which also creeps into my daytime life: if I’m exhausted at work, I think, “Well, if I keep this up, I may not be able to perform at work, and then I’ll get fired… EEEK” 😰) which releases copious amounts of cortisol and suppresses the immune system makes perfect sense as the explanation for my sickliness.

My sickliness wasn’t the only aspect in my history of insomnia that related to this article. I also personally experienced “the power of faith” with respect to my insomnia. Around the age of 23, my Ambien prescription didn’t seem to be helping that much anymore with falling asleep, and if I upped my dosage, I was too groggy in the morning to function well. So I researched various “sleep doctors”, and I pursued an appointment with what seemed like a promising psychologist specializing in sleep disorders, Dr. Anne Bartolucci. When I read on her website “I have helped many patients to be able to sleep again, all without the aid of medication”, I was excited, and in our first appointment, her motherly reassurance touched me. She took me through a breathing exercise in her office which was quite relaxing. I didn’t do any of the “sleep hygiene” practices she recommended (except for the breathing exercises for a few evenings)–I just felt like I had a reliable helper–and I slept like a baby every night for three whole months. It seemed like my insomnia was gone for good, but one night, as I was consciously thinking of this fact–that it was all gone–and how it seemed like a lifetime ago when I would struggle miserably with sleep every night, my scumbag brain said to itself, “That sure would suck to struggle with insomnia again”. And this “triggered” me, and I was back to sleepless nights starting at that very moment. I tried the breathing exercises again, to no avail. I made an appointment with Dr. Bartolucci again, but I had lost confidence in her, and though she didn’t do anything differently, her therapy was utterly ineffective this time, because I had “lost faith”. My faith cured me, and my lack of faith uncured me, not unlike the Christian perspective of the relationship between faith and disease, but easily compatible with a secular worldview.

Disease causes anxiety. Anxiety weakens the immune system, which can exacerbate a preexisting condition, open the way for a brand new condition, or prevent the body from healing itself as it otherwise would. Chronic disease can be particularly anxiety-ridden–not knowing if you will ever get to meet your grandchildren, for example (losing faith in the abilities of the physicians whose care you are under, as another example). When a believer is suffering from both disease and anxiety from the disease, a spiritually poignant moment such as a ceremonial “laying on of hands/anointing with oil” and being prayed for by fellow church members who love the invalid and who are calling upon a God who is believed to be omnipotent and all-loving too, this seems to be plenty for an invalid to regain confidence that he/she will be healed, and that renewed confidence can, in a scientifically explicable way, occasionally cure disease through boosting the immune system. The fact that the confidence of unbelievers can also occasionally cure their diseases (as in the case of the cancer patient receiving the drug that was thought to be a breakthrough cancer treatment, but as further studies showed, it was not in the least bit efficacious) suggests that the psychological state of the invalid is the causal factor, not a God divinely intervening when called upon.

My Christian readers will probably still believe that I am “putting blinders on”, and that I will come up with any convoluted reasoning to explain away these reported miracles, but I contend that my perspective has more explanatory power and fewer holes than the Christian one. Before considering the aforementioned article on psychoneuroimmunology, my worldview could better explain the following facts:

  * The power for prayer/faith to cause healing is much lower than the New Testament predicts (remember the guarantees in the books James and John quoted above). Lots of Christians, of all ages, succumb to terrible diseases, despite heartfelt petitions to their God.
  * Most Christians, though theoretically believing their God has the power and desire to miraculously heal them, act as if modern medicine is the primary conduit for curing disease. For example, when someone feels severely ill, prayer may be made, but few “rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him”–they go see a doctor. My aunt did wait patiently, and the cancer had spread so much by the time her family succeeded in persuading her to go to the doctor, that she is in hospice care now.
  * When the miracles would be most obvious, such as giving a double amputee vet his legs back, there are no reports of such events.

But I couldn’t explain the following:

  * There are uncanny stories when bad off invalids receive and offer much prayer, and within a remarkably short period of time, they recover.

Now it seems that psychoneuroimmunology can explain such remarkable cases, without the need to accept that these cases represent miracles.

Manny: 1. Robert Lee: 0.

😝

Jk, dude. I’m glad you pushed me to consider these remarkable cases. I feel like my understanding of the universe has grown a bit.
