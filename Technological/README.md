# AirBnB + couch surfing hack
Many individuals could pay their rent/mortgage by AirBnB-ing their place for a week or two each month.  But, where does the permanent resident sleep?  Many people would enjoy hosting their friends for a couple nights each month.  Basically, the idea is to enable those who want to host AirBnB to connect easily with a friend who would enjoy hosting the AirBnB host.  So, on one side, it's like couch surfing, but on the other, it's AirBnB.  The gap that the proposed technology would fill is convient coordination of the "local" couch surfing.  Basically, if you want to benefit from this system, you sign up, and you broadcast, "Hey, I wanted to host an AirBnB on the weekend of January 27th, anybody want to have me sleep on your couch that night?"  Or you broadcast, "I have nothing going on on the weekend of January 27th, if anybody wants to crash here."  But the system would take care of such broadcasts in a systematic and simple way.  And hopefully in a way that would avoid awkwardness (for example, maybe you shouldn't just be able to direct message someone to say, "Hey, could I stay at your place this weekend?"  Rather, you just see someone's schedule as free or blocked.

Great way for people with modest incomes to save a lot on their monthly housing expenses.
